			<h1>Building My Spaceship</h1>

				<p>Yes, that is corn. I was born in a tiny farm town of less than 6,000 people in the middle of Illinois. My dad was a farmer, and his dad was a farmer, and his dad was a farmer, and his dad was probably a farmer.  My mom's dad was a fisherman. Very earthly right? Although quaint, my head was in the stratosphere, and after 13 years of Catholic School, my sights were set on blasting off to another planet. As an earthling I was interested in the macabre, the odd, and the magical.</p>


			<h1>Lift Off!</h1>

				<p>Let's be honest. I was 18 and I had no idea what I was doing, but I set off on a fool's journey in my space ship anyway! I applied for a program I was vaguely interested in, and picked the cheapest school I got into.  I landed on the planet UMSL studying Criminology and Criminal Justice, and ignoring the student debt I was accumulating. The only reason why I chose social science, was because I took so many AP hard science classes in high school that I wanted to try something else.  Are you sensing a theme here?  I call this a fool's journey, because I never planned out anything that I chose to do.</p>

				<p>I met the crew to my first space ship while I was orbiting the semesters of college.  We met at the Flying Saucer Draught Emporium(For real, you can't make this stuff up) and served brews to BeerKnurds(seriously, it's a real thing) and baseball fans. My Saucer girls and I bartended our way across the galaxy together until I completed my Master's degree in Criminology and Criminal Justice. I had applied for a Teaching Assistant position and was lucky enough to be selected.  Since it was a funded position, I didn't turn down the opportunity.  This didn't stop me from accumulating more student debt and using my loans to buy a car and fly to the planets Belgium, The Netherlands, and Germany.</p>

			<h1>Mission Scrubbed</h1> 
				<p>Not all journeys will last forever, and the Flying Saucer ended up closing right after I graduated with my Master's. Always the Fool, I was having so much fun with my crew that I never stopped to think about what I would use my degree for. Again, without planning anything out, I started applying for government jobs at random because I had rent to pay! Somehow I managed to become a doula in the process. It was a pit stop on my way when I was searching for another habitable planet...</p> 


			<h1>The Black Hole</h1>

				<p>As I was applying for random government jobs, one of them ended up working out, or so I thought. I started working for Missouri Department of Corrections. I became a case manager. It was a somewhat habitable planet. I was learning a lot, but sometimes the climate was a little too hot, the inhabitants were not the most friendly, and it was very far from home.  I found another case manager job at a jail on another planet closer to home, but it was a little too macabre for my soul. Needless to say, I got too close to a black hole and I got sucked in.</p>


			<h1>Launch Code</h1>

				<p>Being sucked into the black hole was not fun. I was stretched and twisted and crunched beyond my limits, but I finally came out on the other side in a new dimension. I applied for Launch Code, but this time, it wasn't a fool's journey.  I actually planned and considered why I might want to join the Launch Code crew. I thought about what I wanted my career to look like, and what I like to do on a daily basis. I like solving problems, evidenced by my ability to finish a Master's degree just because I couldn't turn it down.  A fool at heart, I love a good adventure, and a web development career builds space ships that travel to many different planets.  Some planets are creative, some are intellectual, and others mundane. Most importantly, Launch Code has a crew that will help you travel to any planet you desire, whether it be macabre, odd, or magical.
